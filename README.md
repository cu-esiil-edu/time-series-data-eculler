# Assignment stars-02-time-series

This repository contains specifications and instructions for an Earth Data Science workflow in Python. You should see your username at the end of the name of the repository - if so, you can edit these files as much as you need! Your task:
  1. **Fork** this repository (`Fork` button on the upper left).
     > This means you own your work and can share it easily with others
  2. Open a GitHub Codespace (Green `Code` button, Codespaces tab)
  2. Complete the challenges in each `.ipynb` notebook
  2. **Commit** and **Sync** the changes to Github.

Once your instructor has reviewed your work, they will leave you some feedback in an `.html` file. Unfortunately, GitHub does not yet support rendering of `.html` files -- you will need to:
  1. Click on the feedback `.html` file in GitHub
  2. Click the download icon (it has a downward-facing arrow)
  3. Open the downloaded file in a webbrowser like Chrome or Firefox. You may need to right-click on the file to get this option.
